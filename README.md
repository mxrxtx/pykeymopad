# What is Pykeymopad
Pykeymopad is designed for you to use your gamepad as a mouse and keyboard. Currently in beta stage.

# How to use Pykeymopad
Light and very simple to use. Does not require special permission. You should only have python and pygame module installed on your computer. Of course a gamepad. 

Step 1: 
If it is not installed, install python on your computer. When installing Python on your computer, select the custom install option and tick all boxes. Otherwise, you may have problems with the second step.
Python download link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 2: 
If it is not installed, install pygame on your computer. Open cmd and type ```pip install pygame``` in the command line or you can go to this page https://pypi.org/project/pygame/

Step 3:
Connect your gamepad to the computer and open the test.py file. Test if your gamepad is working. The value of the key we press will return from 0 to 1. For example: In this example, the value returns 1 because the button is pressed to 0.

Run the pykeymopad.py file. Yes step 4 is that short :smile:
